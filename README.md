# üìù Todo List Manager

A Python command-line project that manages a todo list. Personalized and user-friendly, it's a simple and efficient way to manage your tasks.

## The Todo List Manager allows you to:

1. Add tasks, with details including task name, priority level (High/Medium/Low), due date, and category (Work/Personal/School etc.).
2. View all tasks, along with their details and status (completed or not).
3. Mark tasks as completed.
4. Personalized greeting using your name!

Each task is stored as a dictionary, with all the task details, in a list. The task list and user interactions are managed using a while loop, functions, and conditionals, as per requirements.

## How to Run

Simply run the Python file `TODO.py` on your terminal:

```bash
python3 TODO.py
```

This will start the program and first ask for your name. After that, you can choose options from the menu to manage your tasks.

## Requirements

Enjoy managing your tasks in a fun and efficient way!
